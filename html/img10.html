   <h1>VEZZINI&CHEN Art Gallery Brochure</h1>
   <p>
      This is an exhibition brochure designed specifically for contemporary sculpture artists Vezzini and Chen.
      This booklet contains information about Vezzini&Chens’ most famous works and their descriptions.
All the contents are from Vezzini&Chen’s website. I did some research on their sculptures in order to fully understand and came out with a perfect color palette for it. I spent three weeks in class for this project, several revisions were made before the final version. </p>
