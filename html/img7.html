   <h1>Macaw Poster</h1>
   <p>
      Design Foundations (ARTS 190-04) Project #4: Choose an animal and make a poster for it. The grading is based on how interesting the composition is. I picked Macaw as the main character of the poster, the reason why I chose it is because how colorful this animal is. The one at the front is the most colorful and detailed. They further they go, the less colorful and detailed they are, and the last one is fading into the background. All of them have
different positions.</p>
